# Overview
The aplication is based in Next JS framework, I used Firebase to fetch the data.json and to count votes. I managed the global state using useContext hook and localStorage.


## Tech
The third party packages and framework I used apart from Next JS and React are:

- [React Moment]
- [React Device Detect]
- [TailwindCSS]

## Installation

For development environment use:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production environments use:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
I hope I have met your expectations, for any quesiton you have my email.
Thank you for your time.
